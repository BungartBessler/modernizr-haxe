haXe wrapper for Modernizr. Modernizr is a script that will detect native CSS3 and 
HTML5 features available in the current UA and provide an object containing all 
features with a true/false value, depending on whether the UA has native support 
for it or not.

INFO

Only one check is missing. Modernizr.inputtypes.datetime-local. haXe cant have '-' in
a variable name. Still thinking if I can force this somehow...


CLIENT
------
Use compile.hxml to create javascript source. Then launch example/index.html
You will see all values printed to screen. This values depend on what your browser supports.

Files in folder bin/ are javascript files, but file ending changed to .hx for no reason.
